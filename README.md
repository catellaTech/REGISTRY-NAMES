Lesson 1 is for the creation of a SimpleRegistry (details [here](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/mentorship2022/issues/1)) inspired by the [Hashmasks name registry](https://www.thehashmasks.com/names).

Users may register any number of names to their address as long as they are not already held by another address and may also release any of those names they hold.

This implementation uses Foundry and all functions were locally tested.
